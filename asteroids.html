 <h2> <p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar
   system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million
   kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet. </p>
   <p>The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it.
        Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits
         of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million
         degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the
        steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p> </h2>
